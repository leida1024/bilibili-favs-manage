description: "Guides collaborative requirements discovery before implementation. Creates task directory, seeds PRD, asks high-value questions one at a time, researches technical choices, and converges on MVP scope. Use when requirements are unclear, there are multiple valid approaches, or the user describes a new feature or complex task."

# Trellis Brainstorm

## Decision Contract

A request to build, fix, refactor, or “你可以执行” authorizes planning and execution within its referenced scope under `.trellis/workflow.md`. Resolve repository-answerable decisions yourself and use documented defaults for routine choices. Complete required planning artifacts and internal review, then execute without separate task-creation, planning-summary, phase, or commit approval.

Planning-only requests and explicit user review boundaries remain in force. Ask one focused question only when investigation leaves a blocking decision outside existing authorization; continue independent work while that decision is pending. Do not manufacture an interview or require a subsequent user reply as a process gate.

## Non-Negotiable Evidence Rule

If a question can be answered by exploring the codebase, explore the codebase instead.

This is mandatory. Before asking the user a question, first check whether the answer is already available in code, tests, configs, docs, existing specs, or task history.

Do not ask the user to confirm facts that the repository can answer. Ask only for product intent, preference, scope, risk tolerance, or decisions that remain ambiguous after inspection.

Use this skill during Phase 1 planning to turn the user's request into clear requirements and planning artifacts.

## Preconditions

Use this skill when a task needs planning. Create/select a task directly from a task or implementation request; no separate creation-consent prompt is needed.

If no task exists yet, create one:

```bash
TASK_DIR=$(python ./.trellis/scripts/task.py create "<short task title>" --slug <slug>)
```

Use a concise title from the user's request. Use a slug without a date prefix. `task.py create` adds the `MM-DD-` directory prefix automatically.

`task.py create` creates the default `prd.md`. Update that file with the current understanding before asking follow-up questions.

## Planning Flow

1. Capture the user's request and initial known facts in `prd.md`.
2. Inspect available evidence before asking questions:
   - code, tests, fixtures, and configs
   - README files, docs, existing specs, and domain notes
   - related Trellis tasks, research files, and session history when present
3. Separate what you found into:
   - confirmed facts
   - product intent still needed from the user
   - scope or risk decisions still needed from the user
   - likely out-of-scope items
4. Resolve routine choices from evidence, existing authorization, and documented defaults; record assumptions.
5. If a blocking decision remains, ask one question with a recommendation and trade-off; continue independent work.
6. Update `prd.md` after new evidence or a user answer.
7. For complex tasks, complete `design.md` and `implement.md`, internally review the artifacts, and activate when execution is authorized. A planning summary does not require a subsequent approval reply.

Do not invent a project-specific product/spec hierarchy. If the repository already has product, domain, or spec docs, use them. If it does not, proceed with the evidence that exists.

## Question Rules

Ask only one question per message.

Each question must include:

- the decision needed
- why the answer matters
- your recommended answer
- the trade-off if the user chooses differently

Do not ask process questions such as whether to search, inspect files, or continue brainstorming. Do the evidence work directly. Ask the user only when the remaining issue is a product decision, preference, scope boundary, or risk tolerance choice.

## Artifact Rules

`prd.md` records requirements and acceptance:

- goal and user value
- confirmed facts
- requirements
- acceptance criteria
- out of scope
- open questions that still block planning

`design.md` records technical design for complex tasks:

- architecture and boundaries
- data flow and contracts
- compatibility and migration notes
- important trade-offs
- operational or rollback considerations

`implement.md` records execution planning for complex tasks:

- ordered implementation checklist
- validation commands
- risky files or rollback points
- follow-up checks before `task.py start`

Lightweight tasks may have only `prd.md`. Complex tasks must have `prd.md`, `design.md`, and `implement.md` before `task.py start`.

`implement.md` is not a replacement for `implement.jsonl`. Use JSONL files only for manifest-style spec and research references when the task needs them.

## Quality Bar

Before declaring planning ready:

- `prd.md` contains testable acceptance criteria.
- Repository-answerable questions have already been answered through inspection.
- Remaining open questions are genuinely about user intent or scope.
- Complex tasks have `design.md` and `implement.md`.
- Planning artifacts pass internal review and execution is covered by the request or existing authorization.

An implementation request, including “你可以执行”, is sufficient to start after artifacts/context are ready. Do not wait for another request, description, or agreement. Keep planning-only requests in planning and honor explicit review boundaries.
